          <p>Japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America.[315] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[316] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.</p>
